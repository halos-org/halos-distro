# HaLOS Raspberry Pi OS Distribution

HaLOS is the Hat Labs Operating System, a custom Raspberry Pi OS distribution designed to help end-users run and maintain both Hat Labs and generic Raspberry Pi hardware with ease.

HaLOS is built on top of Raspberry Pi OS Lite, adding tools for web-based management, hardware monitoring, and containerized services.
